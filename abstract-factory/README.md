# Abstract Factory

The Abstract Factory Pattern provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without
specifying their concrete classes. It encapsulates a group of individual factories that have a common theme. The client
code interacts with the factory interfaces to create concrete products, making the system more flexible and scalable.
This pattern is particularly useful when the system needs to be independent of the way its products are created or
represented and supports the creation of multiple product families.

## Pros

- Encapsulation of Object Creation: Separates the client code from the concrete classes, promoting loose coupling.
- Scalability: Easy to introduce new variants of products without changing the client code.
- Consistency: Ensures that products from the same family are used together, which increases the consistency of the
  interface.
- Flexibility: Allows the interchangeability of product families by changing the factory.
- Code Maintenance: Makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend by adhering to the Open/Closed Principle.

## Cons

- Complexity: Adds an extra layer of complexity due to the involvement of multiple factory classes and interfaces.
- Difficult to Learn: Can be more difficult to understand and implement for developers unfamiliar with the pattern.
- Increased Number of Classes: May result in a large number of small classes and interfaces, which can be overwhelming.
- Overkill for Simple Applications: Might be too complex for applications that do not require the creation of multiple
  families of products.
- Dependency Management: Can lead to tight coupling between factories and their product families, making it harder to
  modify the structure of these families.
