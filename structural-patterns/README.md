# Structural Patterns

Structural design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. These patterns facilitate the design of systems
that are easier to understand, maintain, and evolve by promoting the use of well-defined interfaces and reducing
dependencies between components. Common structural patterns include Adapter, which allows incompatible interfaces to
work together; Bridge, which separates an abstraction from its implementation; Composite, which treats individual
objects and compositions uniformly; Decorator, which dynamically adds responsibilities to objects; Facade, which
provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem; Flyweight, which reduces the cost of creating and manipulating
large numbers of similar objects; and Proxy, which controls access to another object. By leveraging these patterns,
developers can create systems that are not only robust but also more adaptable to changing requirements.
