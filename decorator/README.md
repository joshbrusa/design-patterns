# Decorator

The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern used to dynamically add behavior or responsibilities to objects
without modifying their code. This pattern involves a set of decorator classes that are used to wrap concrete
components. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. In the given Java
example, we have a Coffee interface representing a coffee, with a SimpleCoffee as a concrete component. Decorators like
MilkDecorator and SugarDecorator add functionalities (milk and sugar) to the coffee dynamically.

## Pros

- Flexibility: Allows behaviors to be added and combined at runtime.
- Single Responsibility Principle: Each decorator has a single responsibility, which keeps classes concise and focused.
- Open/Closed Principle: Extends functionality without modifying existing code.
- Reusable Components: Decorators can be reused across different objects.
- Improved Maintenance: Easier to maintain and understand compared to a large monolithic class with all functionalities.

## Cons

- Complexity: Increases the number of classes and objects, making the system more complex.
- Debugging Difficulty: Can be harder to debug because of the multiple layers of wrapping.
- Order Sensitivity: The order in which decorators are applied can affect behavior, leading to potential errors.
- Performance Overhead: Adds additional layers of wrapping, which can introduce performance overhead.
- Initial Learning Curve: Understanding and implementing the decorator pattern can be challenging for beginners.
