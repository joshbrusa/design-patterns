# Interpreter

The Interpreter Pattern provides a way to represent and evaluate
grammar or expressions within a given domain, such as mathematical
expressions, Boolean expressions, or simple programming languages.
It builds a syntax tree where each node represents a grammar rule or
a variable. This tree is then used to interpret or evaluate the expression.
The pattern is highly flexible and useful for implementing domain-specific
languages (DSLs) or parsers, but it may become complex as the grammar grows.

## Pros

- Simple Grammar Representation: It provides a structured way to represent simple grammars or languages.
- Extensibility: Adding new rules or expressions is easy by creating new concrete expression classes.
- Modularization: Each rule is represented as a class, making the code modular and easy to maintain.
- Flexibility: The pattern is highly flexible for implementing small, specialized languages.
- Decoupled Expression Logic: The grammar logic is separated from client code, making it easier to manage and debug.

## Cons

- Performance Overhead: Can be slow for complex grammars or large input as it may involve multiple recursive calls.
- Complexity: Managing a large set of rules or expressions can lead to a bloated class structure.
- Limited Use Case: Best suited for small grammars; not ideal for more complex, high-performance interpreters.
- Maintenance Difficulty: As the grammar grows, maintaining the code can become challenging.
- High Memory Usage: Each rule requires a separate class, which can increase memory usage in large systems.
