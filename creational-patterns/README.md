# Creational Patterns

Creational design patterns are a category of design patterns in software engineering that deal with object creation
mechanisms, aiming to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. These patterns abstract the instantiation
process, making system designs more flexible and reusable. By decoupling the client code from the actual creation
process, creational patterns allow the code to be more independent of the specific classes that it instantiates. Common
examples include the Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, and Prototype patterns. Each serves a
different purpose but collectively they address issues related to object creation, ensuring that the system is not
tightly coupled and that objects are created in a controlled and consistent manner.
