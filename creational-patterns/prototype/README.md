# Prototype

The Prototype Pattern in Java is a creational design pattern used to create new objects by copying an existing instance,
known as the prototype, rather than creating new instances from scratch. It involves defining a prototype interface with
a clone method and implementing concrete prototype classes that provide the cloning functionality. This pattern is
particularly beneficial when the creation of a new object is resource-intensive, as it allows for the efficient creation
of new instances by duplicating existing ones. The Prototype Pattern helps reduce subclassing, hides the complexity of
object creation, and can improve performance by leveraging object cloning.

## Pros

- Reduces Creation Cost: Cloning an object can be more efficient than creating a new one, especially when the object
  creation process is complex or resource-intensive.
- Avoids Subclassing: Allows for the creation of objects without requiring a factory hierarchy, reducing the need for
  extensive subclassing.
- Simplifies Object Creation: Hides the complexity of object creation from the client, making the codebase cleaner and
  easier to maintain.
- Dynamic Configuration: Enables dynamic configuration and initialization of objects, allowing for flexible and
  versatile object creation at runtime.
- Preserves Object State: Cloned objects retain the state of the original object, ensuring consistency and saving the
  need to set up the object again.

## Cons

- Deep vs. Shallow Copy: Implementing deep copy cloning can be complex and error-prone, especially with objects that
  have references to other objects.
- Cloning Complex Objects: Not all objects are easy to clone, especially those that involve complex data structures or
  external resources.
- State Dependency: Cloning an object relies on the current state of the prototype, which may lead to unexpected
  behavior if the prototype's state changes.
- Maintaining Cloning Logic: Ensuring the correctness of the clone method can add maintenance overhead, particularly if
  the class evolves over time.
- Potential for Excess Memory Usage: Cloning can lead to excessive memory usage if not managed properly, as each clone
  consumes additional memory.
