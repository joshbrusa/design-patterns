# Design Patterns

Design patterns are standardized solutions to common problems in software design, providing templates for addressing
recurring design issues. They fall into three main categories: creational patterns, which focus on object creation (
e.g., Singleton, Factory Method); structural patterns, which deal with object composition (e.g., Adapter, Composite);
and behavioral patterns, which manage object interaction and responsibility (e.g., Observer, Strategy). Utilizing design
patterns enhances code reusability, maintainability, and scalability while promoting efficient communication among
developers by offering a common language and proven best practices.
