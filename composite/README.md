# Composite

The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to
represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. In
this example, the Employee interface represents the component, Developer and Manager are leaf nodes, and
CompanyDirectory is the composite that can hold multiple Employee objects. This pattern is particularly useful when
dealing with hierarchical data structures such as file systems, organizational structures, or graphics compositions.

## Pros

- Simplifies Client Code: Clients can treat composite structures and individual objects uniformly.
- Easier to Add New Components: New types of components can be added with minimal changes to existing code.
- Flexible and Scalable: Makes it easy to add more elements to the hierarchy without affecting the client code.
- Promotes Reusability: Common operations can be reused for both individual objects and composites.
- Improved Maintainability: Clearer structure and separation of concerns improve maintainability.

## Cons

- Overhead: Can introduce unnecessary complexity if the hierarchy is simple or does not need to be uniform.
- Difficulty in Type Checking: It can be challenging to enforce type constraints and specific operations on certain
  objects.
- Generalization Issues: May require more general interfaces, which can be less expressive.
- Increased Memory Usage: The structure may use more memory due to the storage of additional objects.
- Complexity in Debugging: Debugging composite structures can be more complex due to the increased number of objects and
  their interactions.
