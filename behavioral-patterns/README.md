# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral design patterns are a category of design patterns that focus on improving communication and responsibilities
between objects, ensuring that systems are more efficient, scalable, and easier to maintain. These patterns encapsulate
behavior in objects and promote loose coupling by ensuring that objects interact in a well-defined manner. They help
manage complex control flows and enable objects to cooperate while being independent of one another's implementations.
Common behavioral patterns include Chain of Responsibility, which passes requests along a chain of handlers; Command,
which encapsulates requests as objects; Iterator, which provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially
without exposing its underlying representation; Mediator, which centralizes complex communications and control between
related objects; Memento, which captures and restores an object's internal state; Observer, which defines a dependency
between objects so that one change triggers updates to others; State, which allows an object to alter its behavior when
its internal state changes; Strategy, which defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable; Template
Method, which defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses; and Visitor, which
separates operations from the objects they operate on. These patterns enhance flexibility and object collaboration,
making software more modular and easier to extend.
